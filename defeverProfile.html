			<li>I gradutaed with a degree in biology many moons ago and moved to Brazil for love and my personal goal of catching an anaconda with my bare hands. While in Brazil, I taught various subjects in bilingual schools in the Sao Paulo area.</li>
			<li>Most recently I taught design, which I really enjoyed. Through that class, I began learning about web design, and it was like a fire had reignited inside of me. I really began to appreciate the usability of various websites and how easy it was for me as a teacher to quickly create engaging classes with the click of a button.</li>
			<li>In addition to becoming part of the programming and design learning community, I want to develop apps that quickly help people to solve everyday problems just as teacherspayteachers, youtube and Khan Acedemy did for me. Hopefully I'll be able to turn this passion into a lucrative career.</li>
